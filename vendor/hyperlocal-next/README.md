Hyper is a rock solid [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) HTTP client and server toolkit.
[Unix domain sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) provide a mechanism
for host-local interprocess communication. `hyperlocal` builds on and complements Hyper's
interfaces for building Unix domain socket HTTP clients and servers.

This is useful for exposing simple HTTP interfaces for your Unix daemons in cases where you
want to limit access to the current host, in which case, opening and exposing tcp ports is
not needed. Examples of Unix daemons that provide this kind of host local interface include
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/misc/), a process container manager.


## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file

```toml
[dependencies]
hyperlocal = "0.9"
```

## Usage

### Servers

A typical server can be built by creating a `tokio::net::UnixListener` and accepting connections in a loop using
`hyper::service::service_fn` to create a request/response processing function, and connecting the `UnixStream` to it
using `hyper::server::conn::http1::Builder::new().serve_connection()`.

An example is at [examples/server.rs](./examples/server.rs).

To test that your server is working you can use an out-of-the-box tool like `curl`


```sh
$ curl --unix-socket /tmp/hyperlocal.sock localhost

It's a Unix system. I know this.
```

### Clients

`hyperlocal` also provides bindings for writing unix domain socket based HTTP clients the `Client` interface from the
`hyper-utils` crate.

An example is at [examples/client.rs](./examples/client.rs).

Hyper's client interface makes it easy to send typical HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` with factory
methods, `get`, `post`, `delete`, etc. These require an argument that can be tranformed into a `hyper::Uri`.

Since Unix domain sockets aren't represented with hostnames that resolve to ip addresses coupled with network ports,
your standard over the counter URL string won't do. Instead, use a `hyperlocal::Uri`, which represents both file path to the domain
socket and the resource URI path and query string.
