# Summary

Remove the `oio::Write::copy_from()` API pending a more thoughtful design.

# Motivation

In [RFC-2083: Writer Sink API](./2083_writer_sink_api.md), we launched an API, initially named `sink` and changed to `copy_from`, that enables data writing from a `Reader` to a `Writer` object.

The current API signature is:

```rust
pub trait Write: Unpin + Send + Sync {
    /// Copies data from the given reader to the writer.
    ///
    /// # Behavior
    ///
    /// - `Ok(n)` indicates successful writing of `n` bytes.
    /// - `Err(err)` indicates a failure, resulting in zero bytes written.
    ///
    /// A situation where `n < size` may arise; the caller should then transmit the remaining bytes until the full amount is written.
    async fn copy_from(&mut self, size: u64, src: oio::Reader) -> Result<u64>;
}
```

The API has the following limitations:

- Incompatibility with existing buffering and retry mechanisms.
- Imposes ownership requirements on the reader, complicating its use. The reader must be recreated for every write operation.

Due to restrictions in both Rust and Hyper's APIs, the following ideal implementation is currently unattainable:

```rust
pub trait Write: Unpin + Send + Sync {
    async fn copy_from(&mut self, size: u64, src: &mut impl oio::Read) -> Result<u64>;
}
```

- Rust doesn't allow us to have `impl oio::Read` in trait method if we want object safe.
- hyper doesn't allow us to use reference here, it requires `impl Stream + 'static`.

Given these constraints, the proposal is to remove `oio::Write::copy_from` until a more fitting design becomes feasible.

# Guide-level explanation

The `Writer::sink()` and `Writer::copy()` methods will be kept, but it's internal implementation will be changed to use `AsyncWrite` instead. For example:

```diff
pub async fn copy<R>(&mut self, size: u64, read_from: R) -> Result<u64>
where
    R: futures::AsyncRead + Send + Sync + Unpin + 'static,
{
    if let State::Idle(Some(w)) = &mut self.state {
        let r = Box::new(oio::into_streamable_read(
            oio::into_read_from_file(read_from, 0, size),
            64 * 1024,
        ));
-       w.copy_from(size, r).await
+       futures::io::copy(&mut r, w).await
    } else {
        unreachable!(
            "writer state invalid while copy, expect Idle, actual {}",
            self.state
        );
    }
}
```

# Reference-level explanation

The method `oio::Write::copy_from` will be removed.

# Drawbacks

The deprecation eliminates the ability to stream data uploads. A viable alternative is to directly use `AsyncWrite` offered by `Writer`.

Introduce utility functions such as `Writer::copy_from(r: &dyn AsyncRead)` when possible.
