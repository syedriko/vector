# Summary

Expose services config to the user. 

# Motivation

OpenDAL provides two ways to configure services: through a builder pattern and via a map.

The `Builder` allows users to configure services using the builder pattern:

```rust
// Create fs backend builder.
let mut builder = Fs::default();
// Set the root for fs, all operations will happen under this root.
builder.root("/tmp");

// Build an `Operator` to start operating the storage.
let op: Operator = Operator::new(builder)?.finish();
```

The benefit of builder is that it is type safe and easy to use. However, it is not flexible enough to configure services. Users must create a new builder for each service they wish to configure, translating user input into the API calls for each respective builder.

Consider the following real-world example from one of our users:

```rust
let mut builder = services::S3::default();

// Credential.
builder.access_key_id(&cfg.access_key_id);
builder.secret_access_key(&cfg.secret_access_key);
builder.security_token(&cfg.security_token);
builder.role_arn(&cfg.role_arn);
builder.external_id(&cfg.external_id);

// Root.
builder.root(&cfg.root);

// Disable credential loader
if cfg.disable_credential_loader {
    builder.disable_config_load();
    builder.disable_ec2_metadata();
}

// Enable virtual host style
if cfg.enable_virtual_host_style {
    builder.enable_virtual_host_style();
}
```

The `Map` approach allows users to configure services using a string-based HashMap:

```rust
let map = HashMap::from([
  // Set the root for fs, all operations will happen under this root.
  ("root".to_string(), "/tmp".to_string()),
]);

// Build an `Operator` to start operating the storage.
let op: Operator = Operator::via_map(Scheme::Fs, map)?;
```

This approach is simpler since it allows users to configure all services within a single map. However, it is not type safe and not easy to use. Users will need to convert their input to string and make sure the key is correct. And breaking changes could happen silently.

This is one of our limitations: We need a way to configure services that is type safe, easy to use and flexible. The other one is that there is no way for users to fetch the config of a service after it's built. This limitation complicates the dynamic modification of a service's root path for the user.

Our users have to wrap all our configs into an enum and store it in their own struct:

```rust
pub enum StorageParams {
    Azblob(StorageAzblobConfig),
    Fs(StorageFsConfig),
    Ftp(StorageFtpConfig),
    Gcs(StorageGcsConfig),
    Hdfs(StorageHdfsConfig),
    Http(StorageHttpConfig),
    Ipfs(StorageIpfsConfig),
    Memory,
    Moka(StorageMokaConfig),
    Obs(StorageObsConfig),
    Oss(StorageOssConfig),
    S3(StorageS3Config),
    Redis(StorageRedisConfig),
    Webhdfs(StorageWebhdfsConfig),
    Cos(StorageCosConfig),
}
```

So I propose to expose services config to the users, allowing them to work on config structs directly and fetch the config at runtime.

# Guide-level explanation

First of all, we will add config struct for each service. For example, `Fs` will have a `FsConfig` struct and `S3` will have a `S3Config`. The fields within the config struct are public and marked as non-exhaustive.

```rust
#[non_exhaustive]
pub struct S3Config {
  pub root: Option<String>,
  pub bucket: String,
  pub endpoint: Option<String>,
  pub region: Option<String>,
  ...
}
```

Then, we will add a `Config` enum that contains all the config structs. The enum is public and non-exhaustive too.

```rust
#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum Config {
  Fs(FsConfig)
  S3(S3Config),
  Custom(&'static str, HashMap<String, String>),
}
```

Notably, a `Custom` variant will be added to the enum. This variant aligns with `Scheme::Custom(name)` and allows users to configure custom services.

At `Operator` level, we will add `from_config` and `via_config` methods.

```rust
impl Operator {
  pub fn via_config(cfg: impl Into<Config>) -> Result<Operator> {}
}
```

Additionally, `OperatorInfo` will introduce a new API method, `config()`:

```rust
impl OperatorInfo {
  pub fn config(&self) -> Config {}
}
```

Users can use `config()` to fetch the config of a service at runtime and construct a new operator based on needs.

# Reference-level explanation

Every services will have a `XxxConfig` struct.

`XxxConfig` will implement the following things:

- `Default` trait: All config fields will have a default value.
- `Deserialize` trait: Allow users to deserialize a config from a string.
- `Into<Config>` trait: All service config can be converted to `Config` enum.

Internally, `XxxConfig` will have the following traits:

- `FromMap` trait: Allow users to build a config via hashmap which will replace existing `from_map` API in `Builder`.
- `Into<XxxBuilder>` trait: Config can convert into corresponding builder with zero cost. 

All config fields will be public and non-exhaustive, allowing users to build config this way:

```rust
let s3 = S3Config {
  bucket: "test".to_string(),
  endpoint: Some("http://localhost:9000".to_string()),
  ..Default::default()
}
```

The public API of existing builders will remain unchanged, although their internal implementations will be modified to utilize `XxxConfig`. Type that can't be represents as `String` like `Box<dyn AwsCredentialLoad>` and `HttpClient` will be kept in `Builder` as before.

For example:

```rust
#[non_exhaustive]
pub struct S3Config {
  pub root: Option<String>,
  pub bucket: String,
  pub endpoint: Option<String>,
  pub region: Option<String>,
  ...
}

pub struct S3Builder {
    config: S3Config,
    
    customed_credential_load: Option<Box<dyn AwsCredentialLoad>>,
    http_client: Option<HttpClient>,
}
```

# Drawbacks

## API Surface

This modification will significantly expand OpenDAL's public API surface, makes it harder to maintain and increases the risk of breaking changes. Also, this change will add much more work for bindings which need to implement `XxxConfig` for each service.

## Secrets Leakage

After our config supports `Serialize`, it's possible that users will serialize the config and log it. This will lead to secrets leakage. We should add a warning in the docs to prevent this. And we should also encourage uses of services like AWS IAM instead of static secrets.

# Rationale and alternatives

## Move `root` out of service config to operator level

There is another way to solve the problem: [Move `root` out of service config to operator level](https://github.com/apache/opendal/issues/3151).

We can move `root` out of the service config and put it in `Operator` level. This way, users can configure `root` for all services in one place. However, this is a large breaking changes and users will need to maintain the `root` logic everywhere.

# Prior art

None.

# Unresolved questions

None.

# Future possibilities

## Implement `FromStr` for `Config`

We can implement `FromStr` for `Config` so that users can parse a config from a string.

```rust
let cfg = Config::from_str("s3://bucket/path/to/file?access_key_id=xxx&secret_access_key=xxx")?;
```

## Implement `Serialize` for `Config`

We can implement `Serialize` for `Config` so that users can serialize a config.

```rust
// Serialize
let bs = serde_json::to_vec(&cfg)?;
// Deserialize
let cfg: Config = serde_json::from_slice(&bs)?;
```

## Implement `check` for `Config`

Implement check for config so that users can check if a config is valid before `build`.
