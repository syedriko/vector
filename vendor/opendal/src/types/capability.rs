/// Capability is used to describe what operations are supported
/// by current Operator.
///
/// Via capability, we can know:
///
/// - Whether current Operator supports read or not.
/// - Whether current Operator supports read with if match or not.
/// - What's current Operator max supports batch operations count.
///
/// Add fields of Capabilities with be public and can be accessed directly.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// Every operator has two kinds of capabilities:
///
/// - [`OperatorInfo::native_capability`][crate::OperatorInfo::native_capability] reflects the native
///   support for operations.
/// - [`OperatorInfo::full_capability`][crate::OperatorInfo::full_capability] reflects the full support
///   for operations.
///
/// It's possible that some operations are not supported by current Operator, but still
/// can be used. For examples:
///
/// - S3 doesn't support `seek` natively, but we implement it via `range` header.
/// - S3 doesn't support blocking API, but `BlockingLayer` makes it possible.
///
/// Users can use full_capability to decide what operations can be used and use native_capability to
/// decide if this operation optimized or not.
///
/// # Naming Style
///
/// - Operation itself should be in lower case, like `read`, `write`.
/// - Operation with sub operations should be named like `presign_read`.
/// - Operation with variants should be named like `read_can_seek`.
/// - Operation with arguments should be named like `read_with_range`.
/// - Operation with limitations should be named like `batch_max_operations`.
