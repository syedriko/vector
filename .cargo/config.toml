# We need to bring in `libstdc++` for things that build against C++ (librdkafka, etc) which comes along in the
# `cross` base image but _isn't_ in a path searched by the linker normally. Additionally, our custom Docker image that
# we base on the `cross` image moves `libstdc++` into this custom-looking directory to avoid some _other_ libraries
# included in the `cross` base image from having a higher precedence than some of the "self-contained" libraries that
# Rust will bundle/use for specific targets like MUSL.
